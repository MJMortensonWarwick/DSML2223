        "$P(A)$ (the prior): This is the probability of A in any circumstances (i.e. without any conditional). In practical terms this would be our belief as to the probability of A before looking at our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "$P(B)$ (the evidence): This is the tricky bit! Essentially the is just a denominator that means that $P(A|B)$ is presented as a probability (bounded between zero and one). Essentially this is all possible outcomes that comprise $P(B)$ to include $P(B|A)P(A)$.\n",

She felt she had done quite well and really committed herself, however, in the 4x PMAs prior to this her results had been mixed and she currently averaged a merit. Unfortunately she had been spending a lot of time writing her food blog when she should have been writing, and had been a bit slapdash with her referencing. She was in a real quandary as to whether she would be able to achieve a distinction this time; on the one hand it felt like it had gone well, on the other that wasn't the current pattern. Young Liping sought some advice.\n",

When we think about the numerator then it is essentially, as the story tells us, a balance between the data (2 students achieved distinction having a lower average before out of 18 total distinctions) and her feeling about how this PMA process had gone (a 90% chance). That we define this as $P(improvement|distinction)$ is to say that given the goal is distinction, how many students who achieve the distinction are ones for whom it is an improvement.\n",

That will include our numerator - $P(improvement|distinction)P(distinction)$ - but also the likelihood a student would improve if it wasn't a distinction (e.g. if a student improved from fail to pass or pass to merit). Consequently that is all improvements less those who improved to distinctions, out of all results less those that achieved distinction. We would represent this as follows: $P(B|A')P(A')$ or, $P(improvement|not\\_distinction)P(not\\_distinction)$. In this case we represent $P(not\\_distinction)$ as $1-P(A)$.\n",
